# Advent of Code 2023 in Zig

I just started looking into Zig a little bit when December started.
So I guessed that Advent of Code would be a nice way to dabble a bit in a new language.
However, I didn't find that much time in December, so I just made the first three days.
Moreover, it isn't the most idiomatic Zig code, but maybe someone is interested in it anyway.
